# Bagisto Changes

These are the changes from the version 1.3.3 to 1.4.0,

## Added one composer dependency (High Severity)

- Added `diglactic/laravel-breadcrumbs` for breadcrumbs in the frontend shop. Make sure to run the `composer install`, if you are upgrading the existing project.

## Changes in factories (Medium Severity)

- Dropped laravel legacy factories dependencies and refactored all models to use Laravel 8 class factories. If you have used it in modules try to upgrade or just install the dependency when needed.

## Changes in routes (Medium Severity)

- In admin, shop and velocity packages, this file `packages/Webkul/<package-name>/src/Http/routes.php` is moved to `packages/Webkul/<package-name>/src/Routes/web.php` this path. So if you are upgrading the existing project just make sure the provider registry is updated.
