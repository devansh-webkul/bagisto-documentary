# Bagisto Changes

These are the changes from the version 1.3.2 to 1.3.3,

## Changes from the datagrid (High Severity)

- In the latest version i.e. V1.3.3 compatibility, if you are using `wrapper` and `closure` key in the  module's datagrids, please replace it with `closure`. Only single key is responsible for the manipulation of column. In this version `wrapper` key will get work but this key will get removed in the future upcomming versions. So replace it with `closure` only.
